  abstract        = {The High Resolution Proton-Transfer-Reaction Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (HR PTR-TOF-MS) is a powerful analytical tool used by various scientific communities for real-time measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOC). The analysis of HR PTR-TOF-MS data is, however, particularly demanding because of the large amount of complex data being generated. Based on recently developed or described mathematical methods, we have produced a new software tool, the PTR-TOF Data Analyzer, which greatly facilitates the data analysis process. The new software solution allows for i) a combined Poisson counting statistics and dead time correction of ion count rates, ii) accurate mass axis calibration, iii) an iterative residual peak analysis that detects up to 5 isobaric peaks per unit m/z, iv) time series analysis of both low and high mass and time resolution data and v) visualization of analysis results for fast quality assurance checks. After having been successfully tested by a group of users with different application needs, the PTR-TOF Data Analyzer is made generally available to the scientific community. This will improve the user-friendliness of the PTR-TOF-MS technique and facilitate scientific work with this new analytical mass spectrometer. 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

First-order elimination only occurs for blood alcohol levels of less than 20 mg/dL or 0.02%. The kidney and lungs excrete only 5 to 10% of an absorbed dose unchanged. The maximum rate of metabolism is 100 to 125 mg/kg/hr, although, tolerant individuals can increase their metabolic rates by enzymatic induction, to 175 mg/kg/hr. The average adult metabolizes 7 to 10 g/hr and reduces the ethanol level 15 to 20 mg/dL/hr. Chronic alcoholics have metabolic rates as high as 30 to 40 mg/dL/hr. Children have higher metabolic rates than adults, ranging up to 28 mg/dL/hr. Bingham, E.; Cohrssen, B.; Powell, C.H.; Patty's Toxicology Volumes 1-9 5th ed. John Wiley & Sons. New York, N.Y. (2001)., p. V6 p.394 After oral dosage, ethanol disappeared from the blood of dogs linearly in the postabsorption phases irrespective of the concentration of ethanol in the body; zero-order kinetics was also found in dogs, cats, rabbits, pigeons, and chickens after intravenous administration. The rat metabolizes ethanol more slowly than the mouse and more rapidly than the dog. Urinary excretion peaked after 1.5 hr. After an oral dose of 20% ethanol (amount not specified) to rabbits, the concentration in blood peaked at 1 hr and then decreased. The concentration in the urine reached a maximum in 2 hr, and the concentration in breath reached a maximum in 1 hr. In female ferrets, a 6 mL/kg oral dose resulted in a peak blood alcohol of 202 mg% in 1.5 hr and 50 mg% after 12 hr. Metabolism of ethanol in this range was not a first-order process.

  annotation      = {Ethanol is metabolized via at least 3 different pathways: the ...alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) pathway located in the cytosol of the hepatocytes, the microsomal ethanol-oxidizing systems (MEOS; CYP2E1) located on the endoplasmic reticulum, and the peroxidase-catalase system associated with the hepatic peroxisomes. The ADH system is the main pathway for ethanol metabolism in the body and is also the rate-limiting step. ADH is a zinc-containing enzyme that uses nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as a hydrogen acceptor to oxidize ethanol to acetaldehyde. In this process, hydrogen is transferred from ethanol to NAD+, converting it to its reduced form, NADH. Similarly, hydrogen is transferred from acetaldehyde to NAD+. Under normal conditions acetate is converted to acetylcoenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which enters the Krebs cycle and is metabolized to carbon dioxide and water. The entry of acetyl-CoA into the Krebs cycle is indirectly dependent on adequate thiamine stores. Thiamine is an essential cofactor for enzymes that carry out decarboxylation reactions, such as pyruvate decarboxylase as well as for alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and transketolase. In addition, thiamine is required to maintain normal neuronal conduction. Goldfrank, L.R. (ed). Goldfrank's Toxicologic Emergencies. 7th Edition McGraw-Hill New York, New York 2002., p. 955 The microsomal ethanol-oxidizing (MEOS) system (CYP2E1) is responsible for very little ethanol metabolism in the novice or uninitiated drinker, but becomes more important as the ethanol concentration rises or as ethanol use becomes chronic. CYP2E1 uses nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) as a hydrogen acceptor to oxidize ethanol to acetaldehyde. In this process, hydrogen is transferred from ethanol to NADP+, converting it to its reduced form, NADPH. Similarly, acetaldehyde is further oxidized to acetate as hydrogen is transferred from acetaldehyde to NADP+. The ability of ethanol to induce as well as to inhibit the MEOS system forms the basis for the well-established interactions between ethanol and a host of other drugs metabolized by this system. Goldfrank, L.R. (ed). Goldfrank's Toxicologic Emergencies. 7th Edition McGraw-Hill New York, New York 2002., p. 955 The development of alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) requires a combination of physical and physiologic events to occur, each one of these conditions may be independent of one another. The normal response to starvation and depletion of hepatic glycogen stores is for amino acids to be converted to pyruvate. Pyruvate can serve as a substrate for gluconeogenesis, can be converted to acetyl-CoA and enter the Krebs cycle, or can undergo fatty acid synthesis. As described earlier, ethanol metabolism generates NADH, resulting in an excess of reducing potential. This low redox state favors the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, diverting pyruvate from being a substrate for gluconeogenesis. To compensate for the lack of normal metabolic substrates, the body mobilizes fat from adipose tissue and increased fatty acid metabolism as an alternative source of energy. This response is mediated by a decrease in insulin and an increased secretion of glucagon, catecholamines, growth hormone, and cortisol. Fatty acid metabolism results in the formation of acetyl-CoA and it combines with the excess acetate that is generated from ethanol metabolism to form acetoacetate. most of the acetoacetate is reduced to beta-hydroxybutyrate because of the excess reducing potential or low redox state of the cell. Volume depletion interferes with the renal elimination of acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate, and contributes to the acidosis. Lactic acidosis caused by hypoperfusion or sepsis may coexist with the underlying ketoacidosis. Paradoxically, the arterial pH may be normal because of a compensatory respiratory alkalosis and a primary metabolic alkalosis resulting from vomiting. Goldfrank, L.R. (ed). Goldfrank's Toxicologic Emergencies. 7th Edition McGraw-Hill New York, New York 2002., p. 959 The capacity of the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzyme system is saturated at relatively low blood ethanol levels. As the system is saturated, the metabolism moves from first-order to zero-order kinetics. In adults, the average rate of ethanol metabolism is 100-125 mg/kg/hr in occasional drinkers and up to 175 mg/kg/hr in habitual drinkers. As a result, the average-sized adult metabolizes 7-10 g/hr and the blood ethanol level falls 15-20 mg/dL/hr (3.26-4.35 mmol/L/hr), there is considerable individual variation (standard deviation of about 6 mg/dL/hr (1.30 mmol/L/hr)).
