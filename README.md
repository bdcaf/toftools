# README #

Tof Tools consists of tools for working with Ionicon PTR-TOF files.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Access the HDF5 structure
* readout peak integrations
* read pure spectra
* manipulate pure spectra


### Issues ###

* A full PTR-TOF file is too large to be kept in memory. At the moment it is accessed by SCAN individually - maybe a transparent solution can be created.
* Mass calibration is problematic
