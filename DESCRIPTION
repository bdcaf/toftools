Title: Helper functions to read Tofwerk PTR-TOF-MS HDF5 files.

Description: Functions to work with the h5 files produced by the device. Most
    important is the process.tof.h5 function. WARNING in 0. versions many
    errors will not be caught and development is along what I specifically
    need. Currently the functions for mass calibration and integration are
    quite slow. As the data can get quite big I'm investigating ways to
    parallelize and use dplyr for most table tasks.
